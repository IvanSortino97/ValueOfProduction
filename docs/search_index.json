[["resources.html", "SWS Resources 3.4 Code Lists 3.5 Data Tables", " SWS Resources This section enclose a detailed description of all the auxiliary resources needed by the modules to accomplish their calculation. It includes definition of code lists, used to define the various dimensions of data sets, and data tables. 3.4 Code Lists Code lists describe the dimentions that compose the different datasets, they are designed by the users to store analytical results from SWS modules. Each dataset have a set of codes and their associated description, thus Codelists are used within different sets for the sake of standardization, visualization and metadata associated to each dimentions. The code lists that describe Value of Agricultural Production dataset are the following : GeographicAreaM49 : Represent the spatial scale, it is composed by countries territories, , regional aggregates, regional special groups aggregates, global aggregates. measuredElement : Represent the different element calculated by the plugin through the methodology metioned above. For instance Gross production in different currencies and Gross Production index numbers. measuredItemCPC : Those items wants to take measure of production. For example, commodities and commodity groups produced by a country; timePointYears : The time unit (year) data is displayed for. 3.5 Data Tables Datatables are flexible tool made available inside the Statistical Working System to store a wide range of usefull information. They indeed provide a strong support to R module to record countries and items groups composition, to map conversion factors and to store different type of data. Variable names (column names) of datatables are more flexible compared to those of datasets, they can accommodate all kind of names and are not strictly constrained by code lists or by the domain in which they are stored. Below a detailed description of all the datatable used in the Value of Production module. 3.5.1 Base Year Parameter Datatable : Value of Production - Base Year Parameter Domain : Agriculture Production Usage : Used to define the base year. The plugin will calculate the three-year base period around the specified value. Table 3.1: Input parameter for the base year range. Field Description Base Year Base Year of the Value of Agricultural Plugin 3.5.2 Supplementary International Dollar Datatable : Supplementary International Dollar Domain : Agriculture Production Usage : Used to import International Dollar from FAOSTAT to SWS for validation procedure. Table 3.2: International Dollar data field summary. Field Description Domain Code Domain Code of the dissemination platform Area Code (M49) Area Code M49 Area Area name Element Code Element code for production Element Element name [Int.$/tonnes] Item Code FAOSTAT item code Item Item name Year Year selected Unit International Dollar/Tonnes Value Price 3.5.3 Value of Production - Country Datatable : Value of Production - country Domain : Agriculture Production Usage : Used to define the countries for which the Value of Production is calculated. Table 3.3: Country list field summary. Field Description Country Code FAOSTAT country code Country Name of the country M49_code M49 country code ISO2_code ISO2 country code ISO3_code ISO3 country code Start Date Starting validity of the country End Date Ending validity of the country 3.5.4 Value of Production - Country Group Datatable : Value of Production - Country Group Domain : Agriculture Production Usage : Used to define the countries groups for aggregations. Table 3.4: Country group list field summary. Field Description Country group code FAOSTAT country group code Country group FAOSTAT country group name Country Code FAOSTAT country code Country Name of the country M49_code M49 country code ISO2_code ISO2 country code ISO3_code ISO3 country code 3.5.5 Value of Production - Item Datatable : Value of Production - Item Domain : Agriculture Production Usage : Used to define the items list for which the Value of Production is calculated . Table 3.5: Item list data field summary. Field Description Item Code FAOSTAT Item code Item Name Name of the item Description Description of the item CPC code Corresponding CPC item code 3.5.6 Value of Production - Item group Datatable : Value of Production - Item group Domain : Agriculture Production Usage : Used to define the items group list for items aggregations . Table 3.6: Item list data field summary. Field Description Item Group Code FAOSTAT Item group code Item Group Name of the item group Item Code FAOSTAT item code Item Name Name of the item factor Factor for item aggregation CPC code Corresponding CPC item code 3.5.7 Value of Production - LOG Datatable : Value of Production - LOG Domain : Agriculture Production Usage : Provide a LOG history of plugin runs. Table 3.7: Item list data field summary. Field Description User User email of the user that run the plugin Execution Date Date of the execution Base Year Parameter Base year selected Item aggregation parameter Item aggregation level Countries aggregation parameter Countries aggregation level Source Production data Source of production data Source Prices data Source of Producer prices data Lines writed Data points writed by the plugin Lines omitted Data points not updated by the plugin Lines discarded Datapoints not writed by the plugin "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
