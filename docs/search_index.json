The calculation will be performed for all the items defined in the supporting data table \"Value of Production - Item\" and for all the countries in \"Value of production - Country\", then aggregated at item-group and region level. The aggregation at region level will follows groups composition specified in FAOSTAT, the plugin will also adjust the composition of the groups by years to match the correct composition according to the validity period of each countries. 3.1.1 Input data Flow The source of inputs data for the plugin is structured as follow: Gross Production Value Plugin Input data flow The plugin allows the user to choose the source for both Production and Prices through two different parameters, for instance, if some data is currently unavailable in Disseminated Datasets it is possible to select another source for the calculation. It is worth noting that pulling data from production datasets may lead to different results with respect to the disseminated one since some of the source data may differ or miss respect to FAOSTAT data. 3.2 Aggregates The plugin calculate the Gross Production value at different aggregation value : Item groups and Regions Regions and single-Items Item groups and Regions. The items and countries group lists are obtained from the Definitions and Standards section of the dissemination platform website ( FAOSTAT ). They are described and reported on the SWS Resources section section of this documentation. It is important that the technical unit validate those table to ensure that they are up-to-date and the right aggregations are performed. 3.3 Run the module Log-in into SWS; Select New Query and choose Agriculture Production Domain, Value of Agricultural Production dataset; Select the geographicAreaM49, measuredElement, measuredItemCPC and timePointYears in which you are interested and run the query; Running Session Once you created your session select run plugin as shown in picture below; Running Plugin Select the parameters: base year, level of aggregation and Data sources. The user can also choose the execution method for the plugin, if many elements and long time-span are selected, it is suggested to choose the send me an email option since it can take a few hours to run entirely.
