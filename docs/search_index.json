The calculation will be performed for all the items defined in the supporting table and then aggregated at item group level and countries group level. If the production data in not available for a certain commodity, through the function production_gap_filler.R, the plugin will perform a three year mean of the production value of the three past years. If also this information are not provided, it will take the last available production value in the past. 3.0.1 Supporting R function Description of the supporting R function written for the plugin. 3.0.1.1 production_gap_filler.R To provide the Value of Production plugin a more consistent dataset, some of the production data are estimated through this plugin. For computation speed purpose, the plugin will detect only rows with non available data (NA) and will attempt to fill them. The procedure follows data flow shown in figure below. The function will detect the missing values and try to perform a three year average of the production value of the three years before. If this data is not available it will scan for the first available production value in the past and will replicate its value. The plugin will return NA if no production values is found in the past for the specific country and commodity. production_gap_filler Data Flow 3.1 Aggregates The plugin calculate the Gross Production value at different aggregation value : item groups and area area groups and item item groups and area groups. The items and countries group lists are obtained from the Definitions and Standards section of the dissemination platform website ( FAOSTAT ). They are described and reported on the SWS Resources section section of this documentation. It is important that the technical unit validate those table to ensure that they are up-to-date and the right aggregations are performed. 3.2 Run the module Log-in into SWS; Select New Query and choose Test - Ivan Sortino (Provvisorio) Domain and Gross Production Value dataset; Select the geographicAreaM49, measuredElement, measuredItemCPC and timePointYears in which you are interested and run the query; Once you created your session select run plugin as shown in picture below; Running plugin Select the parameters: base year and level of aggregation.
