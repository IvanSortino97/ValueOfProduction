# Value Of Agricultural Production 

Production and producer prices are defined according to established FAO standards. For instance the concept of production may change according to the specific commodity and can be summarized as follows: 

**Crop production data** refer to the actual harvested production from field or orchard and gardens, excluding harvesting and threshing losses and the part of crop non harvested. Production includes also the quantities sold in the market (marketed production) and the quantities consumed by the producers (autoconsumption).
Crop production is stored in metric tonnes.

**Livestock production data** is more commodity-specific, evaluated by weights and adjusted by conversion factors to provide comparable data.

**Producer prices** refers to the prices received by farmers per unit, usually a metric ton of product. The producer prices are also often defined "farm gate prices", and should includes all the costs incurred by the farmers to produce the commodity and its own profit.

Various approaches are considered for the definition of _Agricultural Production_, spacing from _gross_ concept to _net_ depending on the treatment of the double-counting error. The latter is defined as the error that incur when we do not remove inputs used during the production cycle. 
Agricultural inputs are indeed divided in three categories :

  1. commodities required as inputs for their own production, such as seed or hatching eggs;
  2. Inputs of other agricultural commodities as those used for feeding livestock;
  3. Non-agricultural inputs such fertilizers or pesticides.


## Gross Production Value 

Value of gross production is calculated by multiplying gross production (in tonnes) by production prices at farm gate. In this phase of aggregation the overall value of production in considered. Indeed a double-counting error rise if we do not remove seeds and feed used within the agricultural sector, we refer then to this value as "gross production".
Value of gross production is provided in both International Dollar [Int.\$], Standard Local Currency [SLC] and United States Dollar [US\$].
Value of production expressed in constant terms is derived using the average
prices of three selected years, named base period. Constant price series shows the changes in quantity or volume of the product changes over time.
