## Gross Production Value 

Value of gross production is calculated by multiplying gross production (in tonnes) by output prices at farm gate. In this phase of aggregation the overall value of production in considered. Indeed a double-counting error rise if we do not remove seed and feed used 

Value of gross production has been compiled by multiplying gross production in physical
terms by output prices at farm gate. Thus, value of production measures production in
monetary terms at the farm gate level. Since intermediate uses within the agricultural sector
(seed and feed) have not been subtracted from production data, this value of production
aggregate refers to the notion of "gross production".
Value of gross production is provided in both current and constant terms and is expressed in
US dollars and Standard Local Currency (SLC). The current value of production measures
value in the prices relating to the period being measured. Thus, it represents the market value
of food and agricultural products at the time they were produced. Knowing this figure is
helpful in understanding exactly what was happening within a given economy at that point in
time. Often, this information can help explain economic trends that emerged in later periods
and why they took place. Value of production in constant terms is derived using the average
prices of a selected year or years, known as the base period. Constant price series can be used
to show how the quantity or volume of products has changed, and are often referred to as
volume measures. The ratio of the current and constant price series gives a measure of price
movements.
US dollar figures for value of gross production are converted from local currencies using
official exchange rates as prevailing in the respective years. The SLC of a country is the local
currency prevailing in the latest year. Expressing data series in one uniform currency is useful
because it avoids the influence of revaluation in local currency, if any, on value of production.
Please note that livestock value of production is measured in terms of indigenous meat.

## Gross Prooduction Value Plugin 

The Gross Production Value validation plugin have the following workflow :

From Input data --> Reference tables --> Gross Production calculations --> Final Output

![Gross Production Value Plugin Data Flow  ](./images/data_flow.png){ width=150% }


The inputs for the Gross Production plugin are the Agriculture Production value and International Dollar Prices. The calculation will be performed for all the items defined in the supporting table and then aggregated at item group level and countries group level.
If the production data in not available for a certain commodity, through the function `production_gap_filler.R`,  the plugin will perform a three year mean of the production value of the three past years. If also this information are not provided, it will take the last available production value in the past.



### Supporting R function

Description of the supporting R function written for the plugin.

#### production_gap_filler.R

To provide the Value of Production plugin a more consistent dataset, some of the production data are estimated through this plugin. 
For computation speed purpose, the plugin will detect the row with non available data (`NA`) and will attempt to fill them. The procedure follow the data flow shown in [figure](#fun_data_flow) below. 
The function will detect the missing values and try to perform the three year average of the production value of the tree years before. If this data is not available it will scan for the first available production value in the past and will replicate its value. The plugin will return `NA` if no production values is found in the past for the specific country and commodity.

## Aggregates

The plugin calculate the Gross Production value at different aggregation value :

  - item groups and area 
  
  - area groups and item
  
  - item groups and area groups.
  
The items and countries group lists are obtained from the "Definitions and Standards" section of the dissemination platform website ( [FAOSTAT](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QV) ).
They are described and reported on the [SWS Resources section](#resources) section of this documentation.

It is important that the technical unit validate those table to ensure that they are up-to-date and the right aggregations are performed. 

## Run the module

  1. Log-in into [SWS](https://sws.fao.org/);
  
  2. Select **New Query** and choose `Test - Ivan Sortino` (Provvisorio) Domain and `Gross Production Value` dataset;
  
  3. Select the geographicAreaM49, measuredElement, measuredItemCPC and timePointYears in which you are interested and run the query;
  
  4. Once you created your session select run plugin as shown in [picture below](#screenuno);
