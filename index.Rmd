# About

The aim of this module is to calculate the Value of Agriculture production within the Statistical Working System (SWS). The implementation of the procedure needs to be validated by matching the results disseminated by FAO until now. 
In order to perform the validation, disseminated data needs to be available within the SWS. Data are imported from different FAOSTAT domain into SWS _Dissiminated Dataset_. 
After the validation, the procedure will be applied on the corresponding production value and prices presents within the system and stored in a new "Value of Production" dataset.


## Build up data for validation of procedure

For the validation of the existing procedure data are imported from different FAOSTAT domain. For instance: 

  - Production data are obtained from FAOSTAT ["_Crops and livestock products_"](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL) domain and uploaded on SWS `"FAOSTAT production data"` datatable;
  
  - International prices are obtained from FAOSTAT ["_Producer Prices - Supplementary_"](http://fenix.fao.org/faostat/internal/en/#data/PX) dataset and uploaded on SWS `"Supplementary International Dollar"` datatable;
  
  - Country list is obtained from _Definitions and standards_ section of FAOSTAT ["Value of Production"](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QV) dataset and uploaded into SWS `"Value of production - country/region"` datatable;

  -  Country group list is obtained from _Definitions and standards_ section of FAOSTAT ["Value of Production"](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QV) dataset and uploaded into SWS `"Value of Production - Country Group"` datatable;

  - Item list is obtained from _Definitions and standards_ section of FAOSTAT ["Value of Production"](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QV) dataset and uploaded into SWS `"Value of Production - Item"` datatable;
  
  - Item group list is obtained from _Definitions and standards_ section of FAOSTAT ["Value of Production"](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QV) dataset and uploaded into SWS `"Value of Production - Item group"` datatable;
  
A detailed description of each supporting datatable is reported in [SWS resources](#datatables) section of this documentation. 

Since historical disseminated data may differ from those present on the Statistical Working System, it is necessary to make it available on SWS. To do this the CSI-SWS technical team need to retrieve the data from the the dissemination platform (FAOSTAT) and update it on `Disseminated Domain`. Once the procedure is done, Production and Prices data will be in line with disseminated one and the calculation should match the historical data.

## SWS implementation procedure

Once the procedure have been validated, the module will pull its data directly within the working system database. For instance :

  - Production data are stored in  `agriculture` domain, dataset `aproduction`;
  
  - Prices data are stored in `producer prices` domain, dataset `international dollar prices`.
  
The module will then refer to data present on those dataset to calculate Value of Production.
