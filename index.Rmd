# About

The aim of this module is to import into the Statistical Working System (SWS) the procedure to calculate the Value of Agricultural Production already in use in FAO. 
To validate the procedure implemented, the calculations are performed on the already disseminated data in order to obtain the same results as before. Data are imported from different FAOSTAT domain into some SWS datatable and then the calculation are done. After the validation of the procedure and the matching of the obtained results the calculations will be performed on the data pulled from the corresponding dataset present on SWS.

## Build up data for validation of procedure

For the validation of the existing procedure data are imported from different FAOSTAT domain. For instance: 

  - Production data are obtained from FAOSTAT "_Crops and livestock products_" section of "_Production_" domain and uploaded on a SWS datatable named "_FAOSTAT production data_";
  
  - International prices are obtained from the FAOSTAT "_Producer Prices - Supplementary_" dataset and uploaded on the SWS "_Supplementary International Dollar_" datatable;
  
  - Country list is obtained from _Definitions and standards_ section of the FAOSTAT "Value of Production" dataset and uploaded into the "_Value of production - country/region_" SWS datatable;

  -  Country group list is obtained from _Definitions and standards_ section of the FAOSTAT "Value of Production" dataset and uploaded into the "_Value of Production - Country Group_" SWS datatable;

  - Item list is obtained from _Definitions and standards_ section of the FAOSTAT "Value of Production" dataset and uploaded into the "_Value of Production - Item_" SWS datatable;
  
  - Item group list is obtained from _Definitions and standards_ section of the FAOSTAT "Value of Production" dataset and uploaded into the "_Value of Production - Item group_" SWS datatable;
  
A detailed description of each supporting datatable is reported in [SWS resources](#resources) section of this documentation. 

Since historical disseminated data may differ from those present on the Statistical Working System, it is necessary to make it available on SWS. To do this the CSI-SWS technical team need to retrieve the data from the the dissemination platform (FAOSTAT) and update it on `Disseminated Domain`. Once the procedure is done, Production and Prices data will be in line with disseminated one and the calculation should match the historical data.

## SWS implementation procedure

Once the procedure have been validated, the module will pull its data directly within the woriking system database. For instance :

  - Production data are stored in  `agriculture` domain, dataset `aproduction`;
  
  - Prices data are stored in `producer prices` domain, dataset `international dollar prices`.
  
The module will then refer to data present on those dataset to calculate Value of Production.
